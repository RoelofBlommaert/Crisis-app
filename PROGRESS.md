# Progress Log — Crisis & Connectivity Monitor

Running log of what's been done on this project and what's next.
See `Documentation/Relevance and function.txt` for the app concept and
`Documentation/Data ideation.txt` for the data source decisions.

## 2026-09-14

- Repo scaffolding created: `App/`, `Data/` (with `CBS flight patterns/`,
  `GDELT/`, `Reliefweb and GDACS/` subfolders), `Documentation/`.
- Wrote up the concept and data-source rationale in `Documentation/`.
- Decided against OpenSky historical flight data (anonymous tier is
  live-only); using Eurostat/CBS seasonal travel stats as the travel
  trend layer instead. OpenSky may still be used for an optional
  live-snapshot map view.
- All folders currently empty except docs — no data pulled and no app
  code written yet.
- Added this progress file and confirmed the repo is connected to
  GitHub (`origin` → RoelofBlommaert/Crisis-app), working tree clean.

### Next up
- [ ] Build GDELT pull (tension score per country/day) — first data layer
- [ ] Pull Eurostat/CBS outbound travel baseline data
- [ ] Pull ReliefWeb/GDACS confirmed event data
- [ ] Merge the three sources into one per-country/per-period dataset
- [ ] Build dashboard/visualization in `App/`
